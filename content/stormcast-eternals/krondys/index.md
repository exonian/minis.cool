title: Krondys
description: Inspired by his lore in the battletome, I decided to paint my Krondys as though the realm of Azyr were visible through him wherever he actually is in the realms. This let me make mine a really unique piece as well as take a chance to view Azyr outside of the Sigmarite cities we usually see, and remember thereâ€™s a whole realm out there.
